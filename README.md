## Introduction ðŸ‘‹

This website is intended to be deployed to improve my online presence as well as practice some web development. The current site includes a brief introduction of myself, my work experiences and my educational background. I have also added contact information on the site in case someone wants to reach out.

## Change Log:

**May 5, 2019: Initial Version (current)**

* Basic webpage with About, Resume, Education, Contact section.

## Future Direction ðŸš€

While this site is intended as a portfolio I am aware that there is currently no projects deployed or linked up to the site as of its current iteration. This is very much a work in progress. I will be spending more time editing out the project description first before it gets linked in the site but that is already on the TO DO list for this project. :dart:

It would be interesting to see if I can figure out a way to make this webpage link up to a Machine Learning model that I have trained before. I am currently researching on that and how to do it. It would be a nice showcase.

## Credits ðŸ’Ž

I would like to take the time to provide credits to this webpage. I am not a web developer so I would not know how to use CSS and JS to build my own site. What I did instead was download a working template from [StyleShout](https://www.styleshout.com). This particular site is based on the [Kards template](https://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/kards/). If anyone wishes to create their own without having to deal with the CSS and JS site I'd highly recommend you try out the free templates of StyleShout.

The background I used was a Photo by [Shahadat Shemul](https://unsplash.com/@shemul) on Unsplash.
